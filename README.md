# detectionVsDiscrimination_fMRI
fMRI project looking at the differences between perceptual detection and discrimination.

All figures in the paper are fully reproducible with the above data and code.

To generate figure 2 (behaviour), run "analysis/makeFig2".

To generate figures 3-5, and appendix figure 4, run "analysis/makeConfCurves". The full brain images for these plots will soon be available on NeuroVault.
